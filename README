##  Singleton and Abstract Factory Patterns demonstration using Microoffice Use Case Implementation

This Java application was created to evaluate the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of the Word90, Word00, Word10, and Word21 generations of word processing applications produced by MicroOffice. The application makes use of the Singleton and Abstract Factory design patterns to control the generation of GUI elements unique to every Word generation, guaranteeing that a test has no more than two instances of any given generation.

## Features
1. Comprehensive testing of GUI components, including Panels, Buttons, and Textboxes, for various generations of Word Processing Applications.
2. Integration of the Abstract Factory and Singleton design patterns to streamline object creation and limit the number of instances for each Word generation.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Java program, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later installed on your system.
2. Create a `testlist.txt` file and list your desired Word generations, with each generation on a separate line.
3. Eclipse IDE

## Setup and Deployment Process
    ### Using Eclipse
	1. File -> Import Project from File System
	2. Select Folder HW2_MicroOffice_Word_Processing
	3. Start WordGenerationApp.java as Run as Java Application

  
    ### Running using .jar file
	command: java -jar HW2_MicroOffice_Word_Processin.jar
